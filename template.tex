        \item Wrote features to capture video stream quality analytics such as audio packet drop rate, stream discontinuities and IDR frame interval irregularities.
        \item Utilized Ericsson encoder GURU API to monitor encoder inputs and automatically switch to redundant backup streams.
        \item Wrote C++ wrappers around NetData API to get real time resource usage data, used to improve the server load balancing algorithm.
        \item Extended open source ETCD C++ wrappers to write transient data which I then used to redesign the server health and status feature, avoiding clock skew problems.
        \item Contributed to common infrastructure by developing libraries to handle backend configurations and subprocess management.
        \item Refactored code to follow RAII principles resulting in unit testable and safe code.
    \end{itemize}}
